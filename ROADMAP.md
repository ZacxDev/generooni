## Roadmap

- Automatically delete stale cache entries
- clean command to nuke the cache
- --target flag to only regen that target and targets that depend on it
- --skip-cache flag to skip cache
- query-dependencies-all, query-dependencies [target], ... command to print a list of file deps (for integration into watchers)
